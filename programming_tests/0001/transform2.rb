=begin

Write code in the count method below, such that I can say...

Transform.new.count

...and counts for the words located in the file input_files/transform2.txt
will be output. (See spec/test_0001_spec.rb to see the exact output)

=end 
class Transform2
  def count
    # code goes here
  end
end
